#DESCRIPTION OF MY TASK
         As part of my VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) coursework, I undertook a project to design and simulate a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using VHDL, a hardware description language commonly used to model and implement digital systems. The primary objective was to build a functional digital component capable of executing essential arithmetic and logical operations, including addition, subtraction, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, and bitwise NOT. The ALU was implemented on the EDAPlayground platform, which offers a convenient and interactive environment for writing, simulating, and debugging VHDL code. The ALU design included two 4-bit input ports labeled A and B, and a 3-bit control signal (SEL) that dictated which operation the ALU would perform. An output port was used to display the result of the selected operation, along with flags such as carry and zero to provide additional output status. Each operation corresponded to a specific control codeâ€”for instance, '000' for addition, '001' for subtraction, '010' for AND, '011' for OR, and '100' for NOT. 
          The NOT operation was uniquely handled by only considering input A and ignoring input B, as expected for logical inversion. Once the ALU module was coded, I developed a VHDL testbench to simulate and verify its functionality under various input conditions. The testbench applied a series of input vectors with different binary values, such as 1001, 1011, and 0001, to validate each operation's behavior. For example, when inputs A = "0001" and B = "0001" were applied with the control signal set to "000", the output correctly returned "0010", confirming that the addition logic worked as intended. Similarly, other operations were tested with combinations that validated the correct functionality of subtraction, bitwise logic, and inversion. The simulation process on EDAPlayground ran smoothly, with no syntax errors or warnings during compilation. Upon running the simulation, the console output and waveform data demonstrated that the ALU responded correctly to every control signal and input combination. This validated the design's correctness and completeness across all required operations. Through this task, I gained practical experience in writing synthesizable VHDL code, structuring digital logic systems, and using simulation tools to test and verify hardware behavior.
           The project also emphasized the critical role of testbenches in hardware development, as they allow designers to simulate edge cases, catch potential bugs, and confirm functional accuracy before moving on to physical implementation. Additionally, the task deepened my understanding of binary arithmetic, control logic, and how fundamental components like ALUs serve as the building blocks of more complex processing systems. Overall, the successful completion of this ALU project not only strengthened my technical foundation in VHDL and digital design principles but also improved my ability to interpret simulation data, debug logic issues, and think critically about hardware behavior. It served as a valuable and insightful introduction to the practical challenges and considerations involved in the early stages of digital system design and verification.
